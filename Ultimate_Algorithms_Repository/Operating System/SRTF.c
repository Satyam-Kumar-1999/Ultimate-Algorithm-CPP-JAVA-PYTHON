//Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)

//Description of the algorithm:
//    The process, whose remaining run time is shortest, is served first. This is a preemptive version of SJF scheduling.
//    SRTF algorithm makes the processing of the jobs faster than SJN algorithm, given it’s overhead charges are not counted.
//    The context switch is done a lot more times in SRTF than in SJN, and consumes CPU’s valuable time for processing. 
//    This adds up to it’s processing time and diminishes it’s advantage of fast processing.

//Decision Mode:
//    Preemptive: When a new process arrives, its total time is compared to the current process remaining run time. 
//    If the new job needs less time to finish than the current process, the current process is suspended and the new job is started.

//Implementation :
//    This strategy can also be implemented by using the sorted FIFO queue.
//    All processes in a queue are sorted in ascending order on their remaining run time. 
//    When the CPU becomes free, a process from the first position in a queue is selected to run.
