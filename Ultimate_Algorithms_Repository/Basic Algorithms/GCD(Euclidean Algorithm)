/*
	GCD stands for greatest common divisor.
	Here we're using Euclidean algorithm to find GCD.
	This alorithm states that GCD(a,b) = GCD(b%a,a)
	So we created a function that calls another recursive function
	which works as the same.
	inside findGCD(int num1, int num2) we keep on calling findGCD(num2%num1,num1)
	until we have num1 as 0
	as soon as we get 0 in num1 we're returning num2
	
	Time complexity = O(log x)  where x = min(num1,num2)
