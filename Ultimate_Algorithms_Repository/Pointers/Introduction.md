# Pointers

Pointers are symbolic representation of addresses. They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference as well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures.
The pointer in C++ language is a variable, it is a locator or indicator that points to an address of a value.



## Syntax:

datatype *var_name; 
int *ptr;   //ptr can point to an address which holds int data
